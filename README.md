# Example Online (Google) Docs clone app

Based on the Web Dev Simplifed tutorial [How To Build A Google Docs Clone With React, Socket.io, and MongoDB](https://youtu.be/iRaelG7v0OU) with small changes due to different APIs in newer versions of libraries.

Libraries used:
- `react` for UI, created by `create-react-app`
- `react-router-dom` for routing
- `quill` text editor library
- `socket.io` & `socket.io-client` for multi-user writes
- `uuid` for unique ID generation
- `mongoose` for storage to MongoDB
- `nodemon` for socket server hot reloads
